## Installation
As a CLI, Logo Generator requires no installation, per se, but ensure that index.js and its associated files and folders are contained in the same folder as shown here. Logo Generator depends on the inquire (version 8.2.4) and inquire-maxlength-input-prompt modules available from NPM.

## Usage
To use Logo Generator, type "node index.js" in Terminal from the folder containing the index.js file. Complete the prompts to generate a logo file. Note that you can either choose from named color or provide your own hexidecimal color to the logo's icon and text. Hex colors should be keyed in RRGGBB format. To see a video of the application in action, click on the screen capture below.
